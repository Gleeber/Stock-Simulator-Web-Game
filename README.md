# Stock Simulator Web App (name subject to change)

Interactive web app where users can simulate stock portfolios using real-world financial data.

## Development guide

*Note: These steps should work on Debian/Ubuntu systems. I'm not sure about
other operating systems.*

### Install tools

Make sure you have `pip` installed. On Debian systems, you can install the
`python3-pip` package.

Use `pip3` to install `virtualenv`, which is a tool for creating and managing
virtual environments:

```
pip3 install virtualenv
```

### Virtual environments

A virtual environment is an isolated Python environment that contains its own
versions of `python`, `pip`, and any third-party Python packages you choose to
install to it.

#### Creating the virtual environment

After cloning this project to your local development machine, open a terminal,
`cd` into the project directory, and run the following command:

```
virtualenv venv -p python3.6
```

This creates a new virtual environment located in a directory called `venv` and
ensures that the virtual environment uses Python 3.6.

If you want to delete the virtual environment for some reason, simply delete
the `venv` directory, e.g. by running `rm -rf venv`.

#### Activating the virtual environment

Activate the virtual environment with:

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

You should see `(venv)` appear to the left of your shell prompt, indicating
that the virtual environment is active.

To deactivate the virtual environment, run `deactivate` or simply close your
terminal.

#### Checking python and pip

After activating the virtual environment for the first time, check that
`python` and `pip` are installed correctly.

If you run `python --version`, you should see some variant of `Python 3.6.x`.
And if you run `which python`, you should see a path that ends with
`venv/bin/python`. This means that if you run the `python` command from within
the active virtual environment, it will use the virtual environment's Python
interpreter.

Additionally, if you run `pip --version`, you should see output that includes
`python 3.6`, and if you run `which pip`, you should see a path that ends with
`venv/bin/pip`. If you run the `pip` command from within the virtual
environment, it will use the virtual environment's version of `pip` and will
install, uninstall, and otherwise manage packages within the virtual
environment, rather than modifying your machine's global Python environment.

#### Aliasing the activation command

You may want to alias the `source venv/bin/activate` command to something
shorter. For example, adding the following line to your shell's init file
(`~/.bashrc` if you're using `bash`) aliases the activation command to `va`:

```
alias va='source venv/bin/activate'
```

Reload `~/.bashrc` by running `source ~/.bashrc`, or simply start a new
terminal. Now you can simply run `va` from the project directory in order to
activate the virtual environment.

### Managing dependencies

**Warning:** Always make sure you've activated the virtual environment before
running `pip` commands, so that you do not accidentally modify your global
Python environment.

*Note: I'm still learning about `pip` and virtual environments. I do not claim
that these are the best practices for Python dependency management.*

#### Installing existing dependencies

After creating the virtual environment and activating it for the first time,
install the project dependencies specified in `requirements.txt`:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You should also run this command after pulling changes that add new
dependencies to `requirements.txt`.

#### Adding a dependency

In order to add a new dependency (where `PACKAGE` is the name of the Python
package you wish to add as a dependency, e.g. `Flask`):

1. Run `pip install PACKAGE` to install the package to the virtual
   environment.
2. Run `pip show PACKAGE` to show details about the package. There should be
   a `Version` line near the beginning of the output.
3. Add `PACKAGE>=VERSION` to `requirements.txt`, where `VERSION` is the package
   version specified by the `Version` line from the previous step.
4. Commit the changes to `requirements.txt`.

#### Removing a dependency

In order to remove a dependency that is no longer needed, run `pip uninstall
PACKAGE`, remove the package's line from `requirements.txt`, and commit the
changes to `requirements.txt`.

### Docker!

As of 4/26/19, our web-app runs on Docker! After installing Docker ([Mac](https://www.docker.com/products/docker#/mac), [Windows](https://www.docker.com/products/docker#/windows), or [Linux](https://www.docker.com/products/docker#/linux)), run 
```
docker pull dgpalmieri/stock-simulator 
```
and then
```
docker run -p 8888:5000 dgpalmieri/stock-simulator
```
Now, it should say somthing along the lines of "This app is running". If you open a browser and go to localhost:8888, you should see the wonderfully feature-full Stock Simulator Web App in its full glory.
